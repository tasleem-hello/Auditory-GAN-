This code is for our article titled"Auditory-GAN: Deep Learning Framework for Improved Auditory Spatial Attention Detection"

The proposed auditory-GAN system consists of a spectro-spatial feature extraction (SSF) module and an auditory generative adversarial network auxiliary (AD-GAN) classifier. The SSF module extracts the spatial feature maps by learning the topographic specificity of alpha power from EEG signals. The designed AD-GAN network addresses the need for extensive training data by synthesizing augmented versions of original EEG data.
